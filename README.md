# Coffee clicker
## The clicker game that isn't

#### What is it about?
Coffee clicker is a java application aimed to change clicker games to something less... *pointless*.
Yes, it does have those basic clicker mechanics like:
```
Click the coffee machine to get cups.
Use cups to buy buildings.
Use buildings to get more cups
```
and so on so forth. But what it also has is a more tycoon feel to it. Employ your workforce, give them the stuff to work with and they will do what you wish.
